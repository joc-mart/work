    <h2>MedTrack App</h2>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="block">
            <p>It is difficult for some people to not only remember what medications they are on or prescriptions that they have, but also what their function is and when to take them.</p>
            <p>MedTracker is an app that keeps track of current prescriptions, reminders, and prescription history to use as a reference when needed.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>First, I conducted user research to get an idea of what features users would like to see. I interviewed friends and family who use medications about their experiences.</p>
            <p>Then I sketched ideas for the app layout. With the input of peer feedback, I went with most streamlined design that still allowed for features most important to the interviewees.</p>

            <img src="../img/medmoodboard.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="block">
           <p>I explored moodboards of different color palettes and typography that are visually pleasing. Being mindful of accessiblity, I wanted to explore options that have high contrast and legibility.</p>

            <h3>Font Family: Lexend Deca</h3>
            <p class="bold">Header | bold 24 pt</p>
            <p class="semibold">Med names | semibold 20pt</p>
            <p class="form">Form prompts | semibold 18pt</p>
            <p class="copy">Copy | regular 16pt</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
           <p>After further user testing, the final font family, Lexend Deca, and final color palette that were chosen are approachable, pleasing, and legible.</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>One challenge was including as many features as is reasonable, considering some restraints related to feasability. For example, interviewees' suggestions to link to Mychart and chat with the user's doctor are features that I'm not sure would be possible to offer.</p>
            <p>Another challenge was in creating the “add new” page- I wanted to include all the necessary information, which proved complicated. When talking to a subject expert, a neurologist, they recommended I add questions that also feature on Epic systems, the software that many medical professionals use. It would be beneficial for the form to be similar to the already existing form that medical professionals are familiar with. Unfortunately, I do not have access to Epic, so I relied on what the medical professional said was important to ask.</p>
