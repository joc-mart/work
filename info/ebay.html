    <h2>eBay Redesign</h2>

    <section class="center">
        <div>
            <p>For this project, I chose to redesign eBay for a younger audience: 18 to 25 year olds. I chose young adults because eBay largely does not appeal to them, even though buying and selling secondhand goods are popular activities among that age group. The expected user for eBay currently is over the age of 25. Sites such as Depop and Grailed provide similar services to eBay, however they are more popular among 18-25 year olds than eBay. There are major differences between eBay and these websites in the visual designs and user experience. In order to redesign eBay to appeal to young adults, I wanted to create a design that is trendy, un-cluttered, and easy to use.</p>

            <h3>Moodboard</h3>
            <p>I explored the possible visuals of the redesign and created two different mood boards. After feedback from classmates, I went with the one with more playful and vintage elements.</p>

            <h3>Brand design system</h3>
            <p>I also created a brand design system (for the desktop version), which define the design choices such as typography, components, color palette, logo, imagery, and iconography. All work was designed and presented in Figma. All the components came together to make a website that is essentially ebay and also something new.</p>

            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <p>To appeal to younger users, I designed the interface to be easy to navigate and aimed to make visuals that are stylish, friendly, and youthful. The users should enjoy navigating through the pages and not have to spend much time doing so. This version of eBay has a navigation that is de-cluttered and includes only the salient links.</p>
